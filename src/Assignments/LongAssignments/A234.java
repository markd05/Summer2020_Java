1. Complete the Car.java class:

Include the following class variables:
* make
* model
* numberOfDoors
* topSpeed
* price
All class variables should be declared case sensitive

Write four constructors:
* The main constructor that can initialize all variables
* A secondary constructor that does not include numberOfDoors, which should default to 4
* A secondary constructor that does not include make and model; both default to "unknown"
* A secondary constructor that does not include topSpeed or price; default to 90 and 0 respectively.

NOTE: Must create 2 class files for this assignment
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
	// Test code here
  }
