    Instructions from your teacher:
2 String variables are already declared and assigned values.
They will hold different programming language names.
Using those variables print the message exactly like below.
Ex:
Assume lan1 = "Java" and lan2 = "SQL"
You need to print exactly:
I will learn "Java" and "SQL" at CybertekSchool.

import java.util.*;

  public static void main(String[] args) {
	//DO NOT TOUCH THESE LINES. TEACHER NEEDS THEM TO TEST YOUR CODE:
	Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
	String lan1 = scan.nextLine();
	String lan2 = scan.nextLine();
	//WRITE YOUR CODE BELOW THIS LINE:
