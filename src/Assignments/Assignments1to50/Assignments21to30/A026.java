    its like bigger among two numbers where :
if(n1 > n2)
{
   	System.out.print("n1 is bugger" );
}
in this problem you need to write a program that checks for the bigger of 3 numbers.
you get 3 int variables: n1 , n2 and n3
if n1 is biggest output: "n1 is bigger"
if n2 is biggest output: "n2 is bigger"
if n3 is biggest output: "n3 is bigger"
for example:
n1 = 1
n2  = 2
n3  = 1
output: "n2 is bigger"


n1 = 3
n2  = 2
n3  = 1
output: "n1 is bigger"

n1 = 3
n2  = 2
n3  = 30
output: "n3 is bigger"
hint: this can be done with 3 ifs and && operator (and operator).
like: if n1>2 and n1>3

import java.util.*;
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
	Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
	int n1 = s.nextInt();
	int n2 = s.nextInt();
	int n3 = s.nextInt();
	//your code here

  }
}
     */
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n1 = s.nextInt();
        int n2 = s.nextInt();
        int n3 = s.nextInt();
        //your code here
        if (n1 > n2 && n1 > n3) {
            System.out.println("n1 is bigger");
        }
        if (n2 > n1 && n2 > n3) {
            System.out.println("n2 is bigger");
        }
        if (n3 > n1 && n3 > n2) {
            System.out.println("n3 is bigger");
        }
    }
}
